Here's a little alarm clock. It works by adding in a time to the field below the clock. Then click "Set alarm" to set it.

The alarm works by checking the time you set against the current clock time. Make sure to match the strings! Ex: use "8:30 PM" and not just "8:30".

It uses alerts to ... ah, alert the user when the time has come for their alarm! Though with more time to flesh it out (and a concrete design), I would likely not use these. But for the purposes of this example, they do just fine.

Also would like to add a bit better alarm setter. I would probably split the fields into individual hours and minutes. Then add a selectbox for the "am/pm" variable. 

Took about an hour and a half. Much of which was spent fiddling with the ".ico" file to get it working properly. Hopefully it doesn't blow up. Haha! Just move the .ico file up a folder if it does. That ought to do it.

To run the app, simply pull down and run "node start.js". That's it!
